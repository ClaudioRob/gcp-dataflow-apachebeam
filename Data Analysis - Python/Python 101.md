## Part 2 - Understanding The Data Modeling User Interfaces

## INTRODUCTION  
This project is going to use the following Python Packages:  
* **NumPy:** or Numerical Python, for array of objects, read arrays from disk, element-wise computations with multidimensional arrays, algebra, fourier transform, random number generation, and integration with C, C++ and Fortran;    
* **Pandas:** pandas combines the high performance array-computing features of NumPy with the flexible  ata manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and  elational databases (such as SQL). Perform time-series functionality. It means, panel data, and econometric term for structured data.   
* **matplotlib:** Produce plots and other 2D data visualizations. It is well-suited for creating plots  suitable for publication. It integrates with IPython providing a comfortable interactive environment for plotting and exploring data;    
* **IPython:** Robust interface that offers interactive and exploratory shell to work along the projects. offer html notebook to connect with python, GUI console, infra for distributing computing;    
* **SciPy:** Collection of packs that can solve some problems of scientific computing such as algebra, statistics, signal processsing, linear systems...;
