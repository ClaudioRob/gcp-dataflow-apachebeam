# Basic
## Part 1 - Intro to Qlik Sense
## Part 2 - Understanding The Data Modeling User Interfaces

## INTRODUCTION  
This project is going to use the following Python Packages:  
**NumPy:** or Numerical Python, for array of objects, read arrays from disk, element-wise computations with multidimensional arrays, algebra, fourier transform, random number generation, and integration with C, C++ and Fortran;    

**Pandas:** pandas combines the high performance array-computing features of NumPy with the flexible  ata manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and  elational databases (such as SQL). Perform time-series functionality. It means, panel data, and econometric term for structured data.   
* Panda is very good in data munging and prep, but not in analysing and modeling;  
* Good Series, Data Frame and Panel Data Type;  
* I/O tools, between in memory nad csv, excel, sql;  
* Handle missing data;  
* Reshape data;  
* Slicing, fancy indexing, subsetting;  
* Merging and joining;  
* Performance;  
* Axis indexing;  
* Time series;  

### CONDA COMMAND  
you can use comands in conda to install, update and delete packages;  
To add Numpy, MatPlotLib and Pandas do the following:  
* go to search on system ad type anaconda;  
* open the "anaconda prompt" (similiar to cmd);  
* type "python";  
* type "import pandas", after type "import numpy" and then "import matplotlib";    

### JUPYTER NOTEBOOK / JUPYTER LAB  
Lauch jupyter lab:  
* go to search on system ad type anaconda;  
* open the "anaconda prompt" (similiar to cmd);  
* type "jupyter lab";  

Shift + enter = run selected cells  
B = Add lines
X = Delete lines  




 

### Import Conventions:  
```py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
